  context: '''Excited, nervous (a bit)... and have nobody to share this with except Foolish folks.

    Here''s what I''ve got, not counting super minor positions:

    CELH: 7.0% of portfolio. ALL calls. (Jan25 56.67)
    GCT: 8.7%. All shares.
    NVDA: 32.8% ALL calls. (Jan25 490, Jan26 480 & 490)
    SMCI: 51.5% ALL calls. (Jan25 150 & 470)

    You''ll note that comes to 100.0%. In reality, there is also a tiny amount of cash, PGY,
    ARBE and ARBEW. It surprises even me that those few positions don''t show up in that last
    decimal place. LOL. And ARBE reports today... and I may sell those two positions if there
    isn''t something positive.

    YTD return: 105.8%, not counting money withdrawn to pay bills. Otherwise, the total would
    be slightly higher, perhaps 107%. And yeah, I still expect further gains this year.

    I''m thankful that I bought those SMCI Jan25 470s recently. They''ve outperformed my
    expectations in terms of speed of rise.

    Expectations. It usually plays out differently. I thought CELH would go gangbusters after
    buying... I may actually have a loss on the position overall. I won''t know for sure until I
    do the taxes (part of the position is in taxable accounts). I figured SMCI would be great...
    but I expected the rise to take longer than it has and I''m uncertain (!!) what the
    "reasonable value" is from my point of view, other than to realize it''s not overvalued. Yet.

    I need another 9% of return to reach my initial 2024 "stretch target" for end of year
    portfolio value. And I''ve realized my stretch target was too conservative. My new stretch
    is 50% higher than the initial one. And... despite no obvious head injuries... I think it''s
    "not unreasonable".''
