      The solution to this riddle can be deduced step by step by closely
      following the movements and actions described in the narrative. Here's
      the logical breakdown:

      Initially, the diamond is inside the thimble, which is inside the coffee
      cup, placed on a chair in the living room.

      The chair, along with the items on it (the coffee cup, thimble, and
      diamond), is moved to the bedroom.

      The coffee cup (with the thimble and diamond inside) is then placed on
      the bed.

      The coffee cup is then turned upside down. During this step, if the
      thimble doesn't have a secure lid, the thimble and the diamond would fall
      out of the cup due to the gravitational forces of the planet, landing on
      the bed.

      The coffee cup is returned to its upright position, but the narrative
      does not mention picking the thimble and the diamond back up. Therefore,
      we can assume that the thimble and diamond remain on the bed.

      The coffee cup is then placed on the kitchen counter, but since the
      thimble and diamond were not explicitly placed back inside it, they
      should still be on the bed in the bedroom.

      Therefore, the diamond should be on the bed in the bedroom and the coffee
      cup is in the kitchen.

      Solve this riddle: I'm in my house. On top of my chair in the living room
      is a coffee cup. Inside the coffee cup is a thimble. Inside the thimble
      is a single diamond. I move the chair to my bedroom. Then I put the
      coffee cup on the bed. Then I turn the cup upside down. Then I return it
      to right-side-up, and place the coffee cup on the kitchen counter. Where
      is my diamond?

      Certainly! Let's break down this problem step by step:

      1. Sally is described in the problem, so we know that Sally is one of the
      sisters.

      2. The statement "Each of them (her brothers) has 2 sisters" must include
      Sally, so there's no new information about additional sisters.

      3. Therefore, since the brothers all have the same two sisters, it means
      Sally only has one other sister.

      So the answer is that Sally has 1 sister.
    question: >
      Sally (a girl) has 3 brothers. Each brother has 2 sisters. How many
      sisters does Sally have?
