    Keen claws and razor-sharp teeth arm this terrifying troll.
    Its pale-green skin glistens with some sort of noxious mucus
    that occasionally drips to the floor, while its creased, hungry
    eyes survey its surroudings in search of a fresh meal.  Deep
    scars populate its body as signs of past conflict, testifying
    to the creature's resilience and determination.

    Behold a beautiful unicorn, with a flowing mane and an ivory,
    spiraled horn!  The horn occasionally pulses with light, surrounding
    the beast with a glittering aura that further adds to its majesty.
    Softly neighing, the unicorn gently paws at the earth with its hooves
    while all of nature seems to sing praises to its glory.

    A giant, fleshy blob with an enormous maw magically floats above the
    ground.   One massive eye stares ahead with relentless fixation, while
    smaller eyes set within multiple stalks protrude from the creature and
    frantically scan in all directions.  An otherwordly glow surrounds
    the entirety of the beast as the eyes resonate with mystical power.

    A glorious blaze of red, yellow and orange fire soars through the
    air in the shape of what seems to be a gigantic bird.  Eyes look out
    from the conflagration with a piercing stare, almost as if they
    themselves could immolate anything caught in their gaze.  The bird's
    beak and talons appear to be formed of diamond, withstanding the
    intense heat that surrounds them and adding to the danger posed by
    this aerial fortress of flame.

    Disembodied souls moan and circle a darkened, hooded figure as he
    slowly pages through a leather-bound tome.  His sunken eyes house
    two faint sparks that hiss with an eerie green glow, shedding just
    enough light to reveal a thin layer of pale skin that tightly
    hugs an emaciated countenance.  It would appear that death seems
    to follow wherever this presence happens to wander, much to the
    dismay of all life that it encounters.
