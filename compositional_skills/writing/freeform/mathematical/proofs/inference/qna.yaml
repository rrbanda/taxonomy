      Let n, m be odd integers. Then there exists integers a and b such that n
      = 2a + 1 and m = 2b + 1. Then consider


      n + m

      = (2a + 1) + (2b + 1)    Substitution

      = 2a + 2b + 1 + 1        Associativity

      = 2a + 2b + 2            Algebra

      = 2(a + b + 1)           Factoring


      By definition, 2(a + b + 1) is an even number therefore n + m is even.

      Let n be an odd integer. Then there exists an integer k such that n = 2k
      + 1. Then consider

      n^2

      = (2k + 1)^2          Substitution

      = 4k^2 + 4k + 1       Algebra

      = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1    Factoring


      Since k is an integer, 2k^2 + 2k is also an integer. So by definition, n^2 is odd.


      Q.E.D.
    question: "Prove the following statement: If n is an odd integer, then n^2 is
      also odd."

      Let n be an odd integer. Then there exists an integer k such that n = 2k
      + 1. Then consider


      n^2

      = (2k + 1)^2          Substitution

      = 4k^2 + 4k + 1       Algebra


      Now from the above result, to show that n^2 is congruent to 1 modulo 8, it suffices to show: 8 | (4k^2 + 4k)

      4k^2 + 4k

      = 4k(k + 1)           Factoring


      Hence, 4 | (4k^2 + 4k)

      Now since 8 = 4 * 2. all that remains to show is: 2 | k(k + 1)


      Case 1: k is even.

      Since k is even, then there exists an integer l such that k = 2l

      k(k + 1)

      2l(2l + 1)           Substitution

      2(2l^2 + l)          Distribution

      Since l is an integer, 2l^2 + l is also an integer. So by definition, k(k + 1) is even.


      Case 2: k is odd.

      Since k is odd, then there exists an integer l such that k = 2l + 1

      k(k + 1)

      (2l + 1)(2l + 2)     Substitution

      2(2l + 1)(l + 1)     Factoring

      Since l is an integer, (2l + 1)(l + 1) is also an integer. So by definition k(k + 1) is even.

      Thus we have that 8 | (4k^2 + 4k).
