    JAB stands for Joint Authorization Board. 
  question: What does JAB stand for? 
- answer: |
    For any vulnerability with a CVSSv3 base score assigned in the latest
    version of the NVD, the CVSSv3 base score must be used as the original risk
    rating. If no CVSSv3 score is available, a CVSSv2 base score is acceptable where
    available. If no CVSS score is available, the native scanner base risk score can be used. 
  question: What are the CVSS scanning requirements?
- answer: |
    Yes, If a scanner configuration change is required (above and beyond normal
    patching and updates) the AO must be notified and approve of the change. 
  question: If the configuration changes, does this effect the scanning requirements?
